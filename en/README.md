# Go language specification translation project

The project aims to provide multiple translations of [Go Programming Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec).

## Introduction

Even the professional Go programmer, they need to read go lang specification document. Because it helps to more deeply understand Go language itself and makes clear its underlying concepts.

Currently, The official go repo donâ€™t support to multi language for spec document. As one of most passionate go lang community, we want to share it with translated version. To provide a better translation management and support multi language translation, we have integrated with Crowdin and Transifex platform.

    We recommends to use Transifex platform for translations.

## How to contribute

If you want to participate in the translation, please visit our transifex project:

If translations are completed on translation platforms, they are merged in specific branch(crowdin/transifex branch) through github pull request.

## Why we have two translation platform

We have some issue to upload markdown files which have completed translation on Crowdin. Crowdin has not supported markdown upload yet. So, we need to introduce another translation platform to solve this issue.
